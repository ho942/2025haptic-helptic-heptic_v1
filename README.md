Real-Time Weight Measurement and Vibration Feedback System
(using HX711 + TCA9548A + DRV2605)

This project utilizes an HX711 load cell amplifier and two Adafruit DRV2605L haptic drivers to
adjust vibration strength and patterns according to the measured weight.
An I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A) is used to control multiple DRV2605 devices independently.

<br>
Features
Read weight data from HX711 load cell.

Control 2 DRV2605 vibration motors independently via TCA9548A multiplexer.

Dynamically adjust vibration strength and pattern based on weight.

Count and trigger events when exceeding a weight threshold.

Interactive calibration and control via Serial commands.

<br>
Serial Commands

Command	Action
t	Tare (Zero Calibration)
w	Weight Calibration (Input known weight after placing)
a	Start continuous vibration
b	Stop all vibrations and reset count

// Read the current weight
float measured = scale.get_units(5);

// Map weight to vibration strength
int vibrationStrength = map(measured, 1000, 50000, 0, 255);

// Map vibration strength to pattern
int pattern = map(vibrationStrength, 0, 255, 1, 3);

// Activate vibration accordingly
drv.setWaveform(0, pattern);
drv.go();
<br>
Notes
Calibration (calibration_factor) must be tuned according to your specific load cell.

When the weight exceeds 2500g continuously, "c" is printed after 20 times.

DRV2605L is configured for Library 6 (optimized for LRA motors).

Would you like me to make a badge set too? ðŸš€
(They make the GitHub page look even more polished!)
Or if you want, I can create a more graphical system architecture (block diagram style) too. ðŸŽ¨
